Ohjelmistopeli

GOAL:
find the evil villain who stole the climate stabilizer and turn it back on

SPECS:

-hero starts at random airport from 30 airports in europe, can move freely

-hero has unlimited range and fuel
-villain starts at random airport and can move to one of 3 closest airports every round 

-flights are free because world government sponsors the hero/player

-every 1000km will raise climate temp by 1C and when climate is +5/6/7 world explodes and hero dies (villain flights dont count to this)

-loot boxes double your money or raise climate temp by 1C (opening price: 50)

HINT:

-every round we get a hint where the villain was last seen in form of a compass point ( for example villain moved last west from you)

-every round we also get to buy MAX one hint (price 100e), the hint tells one letter in the airports ident (can be something else just my idea)

BONUS:

-call to arms: this is the ultra our hero can use once. It blocks 3 airports hero can choose freely for 1 round
